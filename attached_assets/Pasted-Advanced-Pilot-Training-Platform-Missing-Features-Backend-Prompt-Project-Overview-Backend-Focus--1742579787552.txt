Advanced Pilot Training Platform - Missing Features Backend Prompt
Project Overview (Backend Focus)
Develop backend services to enhance the Advanced Pilot Training Platform by integrating missing features across training content intelligence, predictive analytics, advanced compliance tracking, and adaptive learning. The backend should be modular, using C++ (Drogon framework) and Python (for AI/ML) to support high-performance, low-latency processing. Secure data handling, AI-driven insights, and compliance with regulatory standards (FAA, EASA, ICAO) are key priorities.

Final Notes & Integration Guidelines
•	Ensure microservices remain modular and adhere to existing repository architecture.
•	Maintain API consistency for seamless frontend integration.
•	Write unit tests (Google Test for C++ / PyTest for Python).
•	Provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all new API endpoints.
•	Optimize AI/ML models for real-time execution to prevent bottlenecks.
Upon completion, the backend services will provide intelligent training data processing, advanced analytics, compliance tracking, and a structured gamification system, ensuring a future-proof and AI-driven flight training ecosystem.

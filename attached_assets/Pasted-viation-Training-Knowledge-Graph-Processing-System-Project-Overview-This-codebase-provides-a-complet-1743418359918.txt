viation Training Knowledge Graph Processing System
Project Overview
This codebase provides a complete implementation of a document processing system for aviation training knowledge graph generation. The system analyzes uploaded aviation training documents, extracts key concepts and their relationships, and generates a structured knowledge graph for visualization and querying.
Key Features

Extracts aviation training concepts from uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
Identifies relationships between concepts using NLP techniques
Generates graph data structures (nodes & edges) with proper typing
Stores knowledge graph data in a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM
Provides RESTful API endpoints for knowledge graph access and search
Domain-specific focus on aviation training concepts and relationships
Production-ready implementation with error handling and logging

How to Implement
1. File Structure
Place the provided files in your project structure:
server/
├── services/
│   ├── document-analysis-service.ts  (Processes documents and generates knowledge graphs)
│   ├── nlp-service.ts               (Extracts aviation concepts and relationships)
│   └── knowledge-graph-service.ts    (Retrieves and manages knowledge graph data)
├── routes/
│   ├── document-routes.ts           (Document upload and processing endpoints)
│   └── knowledge-graph-routes.ts    (Knowledge graph data access endpoints)
├── database/
│   └── schema.ts                    (Database schema for documents and knowledge graph)
├── types/
│   ├── document.ts                  (Document-related type definitions)
│   └── knowledge-graph.ts           (Knowledge graph type definitions)
└── utils/
    └── logger.ts                    (Logging utility)

2. Dependencies
Ensure these dependencies are installed:
express, multer, drizzle-orm, pg, compromise, compromise-aviation, 
langchain, pdf-parse, mammoth, uuid

3. Database Setup

Create the required PostgreSQL database
Run the schema migrations using Drizzle ORM
Set up environment variables for database connections

4. Integration with Existing Code

Add document routes to your Express router
Add knowledge graph routes to your Express router
Create an upload directory for document storage
Connect the document upload UI to the API endpoints

5. Testing

Upload a sample aviation training document
Check processing status via the API
Retrieve and visualize the generated knowledge graph

Customization Options
Aviation Domain Concepts
The system comes pre-configured with aviation training concepts, but you can extend these in nlp-service.ts:

Add more aviation terms to the AVIATION_TERMS object
Add new categories for different training domains
Customize relationship patterns in RELATIONSHIP_PATTERNS

Visualization
The API provides structured data that can be visualized using:

D3.js for custom graph visualizations
Cytoscape.js for interactive network graphs
VIS.js for simple network diagrams

Troubleshooting
If the knowledge graph isn't being generated:

Check document processing status in the database
Verify text extraction from the document succeeded
Confirm NLP processing completed successfully
Check for errors in the server logs

Common fixes:

Ensure document is properly formatted and contains aviation terminology
Verify database connection and schema setup
Check file permissions on the upload directory
Increase logging level for more detailed diagnostics

Next Steps After Implementation

Add more sophisticated NLP processing for better concept extraction
Implement user feedback for improving concept detection
Add visualization controls for filtering and exploring the graph
Create recommendations based on knowledge graph relationships
Expand to additional document types (HTML, PPT, etc.)

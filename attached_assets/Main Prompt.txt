   // C++ Backend
   try {
     // Operation that might fail
   } catch (const DatabaseException& e) {
     // Log the error with context
     Logger::error("Database operation failed: {}", e.what());
     // Provide appropriate recovery or fallback
     return Result<T>::failure(ErrorCode::DatabaseError, e.what());
   }
   ```

   ```typescript
   // React Frontend
   try {
     const result = await apiService.fetchData();
     setData(result);
   } catch (error) {
     setError(error.message);
     errorReporting.captureException(error, {
       context: 'Fetching data in ComponentName'
     });
   } finally {
     setLoading(false);
   }
   ```

2. **API Endpoints**:
   ```cpp
   // Controller definition with proper documentation
   /**
    * @api {post} /api/v1/documents Upload a document
    * @apiName UploadDocument
    * @apiGroup Documents
    * @apiVersion 1.0.0
    * 
    * @apiParam {File} document The document file to upload
    * @apiParam {String} type Document type
    * 
    * @apiSuccess {String} id The document ID
    * @apiSuccess {String} status Processing status
    * 
    * @apiError (400) BadRequest Invalid document format
    * @apiError (401) Unauthorized Authentication required
    */
   void uploadDocument(const HttpRequestPtr& req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr&)>&& callback) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Database Operations**:
   ```cpp
   // Repository pattern implementation
   class DocumentRepository {
   public:
     Result<Document> findById(const std::string& id);
     Result<std::vector<Document>> findByOrganization(const std::string& orgId);
     Result<void> save(const Document& document);
     Result<void> update(const Document& document);
     Result<void> remove(const std::string& id);
   
   private:
     DatabaseConnection _connection;
     PreparedStatement _findByIdStmt;
     PreparedStatement _findByOrgStmt;
     PreparedStatement _insertStmt;
     PreparedStatement _updateStmt;
     PreparedStatement _deleteStmt;
   };
   ```

4. **React Components**:
   ```typescript
   // Functional component with TypeScript
   interface DocumentListProps {
     organizationId: string;
     filters?: DocumentFilters;
     onSelect?: (doc: Document) => void;
   }
   
   const DocumentList: React.FC<DocumentListProps> = ({
     organizationId,
     filters = {},
     onSelect
   }) => {
     const [documents, setDocuments] = useState<Document[]>([]);
     const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
     const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
     
     useEffect(() => {
       // Fetch documents logic
     }, [organizationId, filters]);
     
     // Component rendering
   };
   ```

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

When generating performance-critical code, especially for the C++ backend, follow these guidelines:

1. **Memory Management**:
   ```cpp
   // Use memory pools for frequent allocations
   class MemoryPool {
   public:
     template<typename T, typename... Args>
     T* allocate(Args&&... args);
     
     template<typename T>
     void deallocate(T* ptr);
     
   private:
     // Implementation details
   };
   
   // Usage
   auto ptr = memoryPool.allocate<SomeObject>(arg1, arg2);
   // Later
   memoryPool.deallocate(ptr);
   ```

2. **Lock-free Data Structures**:
   ```cpp
   // Lock-free queue for high-performance data processing
   template<typename T>
   class LockFreeQueue {
   public:
     bool enqueue(T value);
     bool dequeue(T& result);
     std::size_t size() const;
     
   private:
     // Implementation using atomic operations
   };
   ```

3. **SIMD Optimizations**:
   ```cpp
   // Utilize SIMD intrinsics for data processing
   void processTelemetryData(const float* data, std::size_t count, float* results) {
     // Process data in chunks of 4 using SSE instructions
     for (std::size_t i = 0; i < count; i += 4) {
       // SIMD implementation
     }
     
     // Handle remaining elements
     for (std::size_t i = count - (count % 4); i < count; ++i) {
       // Scalar implementation
     }
   }
   ```

## Testing Requirements

All generated code should include comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   ```cpp
   // C++ unit test using Google Test
   TEST(DocumentProcessor, ExtractsTextFromPDF) {
     // Arrange
     DocumentProcessor processor;
     auto testFile = TestFiles::getPdfTestFile("sample.pdf");
     
     // Act
     auto result = processor.process(testFile);
     
     // Assert
     ASSERT_TRUE(result.isSuccess());
     EXPECT_FALSE(result.value().extractedText.empty());
     EXPECT_GE(result.value().confidence, 0.8);
   }
   ```

   ```typescript
   // React component test using Jest and Testing Library
   test('renders document list with correct items', async () => {
     // Arrange
     const mockDocuments = [/* test data */];
     apiService.fetchDocuments.mockResolvedValue(mockDocuments);
     
     // Act
     render(<DocumentList organizationId="org-123" />);
     await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.getByTestId('loading'));
     
     // Assert
     expect(screen.getAllByRole('listitem')).toHaveLength(mockDocuments.length);
   });
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**:
   ```cpp
   // C++ integration test
   TEST_F(DocumentProcessingIntegrationTest, ProcessingPipelineEndToEnd) {
     // Setup test environment
     auto db = TestDatabase::createTemporary();
     auto processor = createProcessorWithDependencies(db);
     
     // Execute complete pipeline
     auto result = processor.processDocument(TestFiles::getSampleTrainingManual());
     
     // Verify results across system boundaries
     ASSERT_TRUE(result.isSuccess());
     auto savedDoc = db->findDocument(result.value().documentId);
     ASSERT_TRUE(savedDoc.isSuccess());
     EXPECT_EQ(savedDoc.value().status, DocumentStatus::Processed);
     // Additional assertions
   }
   ```

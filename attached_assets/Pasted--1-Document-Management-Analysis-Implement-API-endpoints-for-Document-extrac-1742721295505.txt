### **1. Document Management & Analysis**  
- Implement API endpoints for:  
  - **Document extraction** (parse uploaded documents, extract text and metadata).  
  - **Structure recognition** (detect headings, subheadings, tables, and other structural elements).  
  - **Classification** (categorize documents based on content type).  
  - **OCR processing** (extract text from scanned images/PDFs).  
- Ensure extracted data is stored in a structured format for further processing.  

### **2. Syllabus Generation Backend**  
- Implement backend logic for:  
  - **Document parsing** (extract relevant syllabus content).  
  - **Module/lesson extraction** (identify and separate learning components).  
  - **Competency analysis** (map extracted content to predefined skills/competencies).  
  - **Regulatory reference mapping** (associate syllabus content with relevant regulations).  
- API endpoints must return structured syllabus data for the frontend.  

### **3. Knowledge Graph & Visualization**  
- Implement both frontend and backend for:  
  - **Knowledge graph generation** (connect related concepts, lessons, and regulations).  
  - **Interactive visualization** (display relationships between topics, competencies, and regulatory references).  
- Use an appropriate graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store and query relationships efficiently.  

### **4. Training Program Management**  
- Create a full interface and backend API for:  
  - **Training program creation & management** (allow admins to set up programs).  
  - **Module/lesson management** (associate content with training programs).  
  - **Trainee assignments** (assign users to specific training programs).  

### **5. Assessment & Grading**  
- Implement backend functionality for:  
  - **Gradesheet creation and management** (track scores and evaluations).  
  - **Performance evaluation tools** (analyze progress based on assessments).  
  - **Feedback mechanisms** (allow instructors to provide structured feedback).  

### **6. Other Major Features**  
- **Flight records management** (store and retrieve pilot/training flight records).  
- **Regulatory compliance tracking** (monitor compliance with aviation/educational regulations).  
- **Calendar/scheduling system** (allow scheduling of training sessions, exams, and meetings).  
- **E-learning content delivery** (support video lectures, quizzes, and interactive materials).  
- **Messaging and notification system** (enable internal communication and automated alerts).  
- **Resources management and sharing** (upload, organize, and distribute learning materials).  
- **Performance metrics and analytics** (provide dashboards for tracking user progress).  
- **Achievements and gamification** (implement badges, certificates, and leaderboards).  

### **Final Instructions:**  
- Ensure all features are properly integrated with existing UI.  
- Implement necessary database structures, API endpoints, and business logic.  
- Optimize for performance and scalability.  
- Do not stop for input after adding a few featuresâ€”complete everything in one execution.  
- Confirm once all features have been implemented successfully.

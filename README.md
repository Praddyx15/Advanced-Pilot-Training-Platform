## Overview

The Advanced Pilot Training Platform is a modern web application designed specifically for Approved Training Organizations (ATOs) and Airlines to manage their pilot training programs with cutting-edge technology. The platform features multi-role authentication, intelligent document processing, knowledge graph visualization, and comprehensive training program management.

## Key Features

### Core Framework
- **Multi-Role Authentication System**: Supports different user roles (Admin, ATO Administrator, Instructor, Examiner, Trainee) with role-specific dashboards and permissions
- **Organization Type Management**: Separate interfaces for ATOs and Airlines with customized workflows
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI components

### Document Management System
- **OCR Processing**: Extract text from scanned documents and images using Tesseract.js
- **Document Analysis**: Identify entities, references, and create summaries from documents
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Interactive visualization of interconnected aviation concepts
- **Syllabus Generation**: AI-powered creation of training programs from uploaded documents

### Training Program Management
- **Curriculum Builder**: Create and customize training modules and lessons
- **Session Management**: Schedule and track training sessions and assessments
- **Trainee Progress Tracking**: Monitor student performance and compliance
- **Resource Management**: Manage training resources, aircraft, and simulators

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/UI component library
- TanStack React Query for data fetching
- Wouter for routing
- D3.js for data visualization

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- Zod for schema validation
- Passport.js for authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database (optional, in-memory storage available for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praddyx15/Advanced-Pilot-Training-Platform.git
cd advanced-pilot-training-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Access the application at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Deployment

#### Vercel Deployment

1. Create a Vercel account and install the Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Log in to Vercel:
```bash
vercel login
```

3. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel
```

4. For production deployment:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

5. Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string for session management
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"

The project includes the following deployment optimizations:
- Custom build script that handles both client and server compilation
- WebSocket configuration for Vercel deployment
- Optimized memory store for session management
- Enhanced API route handling in serverless environment
